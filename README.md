# surfs_up

**Overview**

The overall purpose of this analysis was to analyze temperature trends in Oahu, with the intention of seeing whether a surf shop around the location can be viably run over the course of the year alongside an ice cream shop. More specifically, it emphasizes the use of SQLite to gather temperature data. We pulled from two particular months: June and December, as these are during the summer and winter seasons where expected customer arrival is at its supposed highest, and also gathered collective data on both months.

**Results**

- The mean temperature in December is slightly lower in Oahu than in June, around 3 degrees lower
- The standard deviation of temperatures in December is slightly higher than that of temperatures in June
- Overall temperatures in December are around 10 degrees lower than in June

December Temperature Data

**Summmary**

Overall, the temperatures in Oahu are fairly similar in June and December, with temperatures being overall slightly higher in June. Overall temperatures reach higher levels in June, while the mean temperature in June is slightly higher in June, however, temperatures in December vary more as the standard deviation is slightly higher in December. One additional query I would perform is to determine other weather factors in both months, such as precipitation rate, cloudiness, level of sunlight at different times, and whatnot. Another additional query I would like to perform is to determine specific locations that have the best weather and conditions and where people are most likely to appear.
